# Project---WIS-Python-course

This project is a program to calculate the adiabatic fraction (AF) in a cloud.

### short introduction
Clouds consist of adiabatic (undiluted) and non-adiabatic parts. The adiabatic fraction (AF) is a measure of adiabaticity and, hence, of mixing.
The AF is defined as $LWC/LWC_{ad}$, where $LWC_{ad}$ is the liquid water content that a parcel would gain while being lifted adiabatically from the cloud base. [Eytan at el. (2021)](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/21/16203/2021/acp-21-16203-2021.html)   tested different methods to calculate AF values by comparing them to an Eulerain passive tracer.
